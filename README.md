What Is the Zomato Cuisine Clustering Project?
This project uses unsupervised machine learning (K-Means clustering) to analyze restaurant reviews and ratings from platforms like Zomato.

🧠 The idea is:

“Can we group restaurants or customer preferences into meaningful clusters based on what people say (reviews) and how they rate (ratings)?”

You're essentially discovering hidden patterns in customer behavior and restaurant types—without any labels or categories provided.
